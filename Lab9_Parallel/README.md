# Lab 9 Parallel Programming

We have discovered that if we want to write parallel software, our compilers are not yet capable of figuring out our intentions and automatically parallelizing our code. We have however explored how a tool like [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) can be used to provide hints and try to make code run in parallel by utilizing threads. In today's lab we are going to work with the OpenMP library using special parallelism #pragma statements.

# Motivation

Writing code that can run in parallel is important for reasons of [performance](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm) and [reducing power consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling). In languages like C (C++, Rust, etc.)  parallel programming is a real thing that people are using today, so we should keep up with the times! We have previously explored this in our artists homework and lab.

## Part 1 -- Finding your machines specs

* Type `lscpu` on the terminal to find out how many cpus you have.
* You can additionally find some information from the kernel by:
  * cd `cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/`
  * then `cd index0` and run `cat coherency_line_size`
    * This gives us a report of how big the cacheline size is.
  * Progamattically, you may be able to query `sysconf (_SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE)` for example to find your cache line size.
    * [sysconf man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sysconf.3.html)
    * [Stack overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/794632/programmatically-get-the-cache-line-size)

Note, if you are curious about your GPUs on Linux you can try on the terminal: `lspci` (or look under Systems/Preferences/Hardware Information.) Note, there may or may not be GPUs available.

## Part 2 - OpenMP

Today we are going to primarily work on a fork-join parallelism tasks. We are going to be using OpenMP, which is a mature libray that will help transform our serial code into parallel code.

### Task 1 - OpenMP

#### Example 1 - Hello World

Let's first do a little hello world to make sure OpenMP is setup and running properly. The thing to note is that we will have to include OpenMP as a compiler flag to make sure the library is properly linked in.

Try writing in the following example in [omp1.c](./omp1.c)

```c
// A basic hello world with OMP
// Compile with: gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp1.c -o omp1
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(){
  
  // Create our pragma, and then within curly braces
  // run OpenMP on this structuerd block.
  #pragma omp parallel
  {
      int ID = omp_get_thread_num();
      printf("hello (%d)\n",ID);
      printf(" world(%d)\n",ID);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

- Compile with: `gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp1.c -o omp1`
- Run the program with `./omp1`.

**Discuss with your partner and answer:** *answer in a sentence here, what your output is, and whether the expected output is what you would expect.*
*The output returns the hello worlds of different processors. The expected output would return each thread in order, but this is not true because some threads are faster than others.*

#### Example 2 - For-loops

Loops are a common structure that can be looked at for potential parallelism. We must know the exact number of iterations for this to run however, in order for it to be successful.

Try writing in the following example in [omp2.c](./omp2.c)

```c
// gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp2.c -o omp2
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(){

  // Attempt to parallelize this block of code
  #pragma omp parallel
  {
    // Parallel-for loop
    #pragma omp for
    for(int n=0; n <100; ++n){
      printf(" %d",n);
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

- Compile with: `gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp2.c -o omp2`
- Run the program with `./omp2`.


**Discuss with your partner and answer:** *Why is our output not ordered?*
*The output is not ordered because some of the processors complete the task faster than others, which means that the fastest processes return first.*

#### Example 3 - Synchronization

The previous example does a nice job of spawning many threads that print off the thread id. However, we do not have any information about how many threads were launched within our parallel-for loop. Let's go ahead and record this information, by storing the number of threads launched. In addition, we will also add some synchronization (i.e. using the barrier pattern) to print the number of threads. The barrier pattern waits for all active threads to arrive, and then proceeds.

Try writing in the following example in [omp3.c](./omp3.c)

```c
// gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp3.c -o omp3
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main(){
   int nthreads;

  // Attempt to parallelize this block of code
  #pragma omp parallel
  {
    // Parallel-for loop
    #pragma omp for
    for(int n=0; n <100; ++n){
      printf(" %d",n);
    }
    // Master thread waits
    #pragma omp barrier
    if(omp_get_thread_num()==0){
        nthreads = omp_get_num_threads();
    }
  }

  printf("\nSolved problem with %d threads\n",nthreads);
 
  return 0;
}

```

- Compile with: `gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp3.c -o omp3`
- Run the program with `./omp3`.

#### Example 4 - Fibonacci Sequence

For our first example, take a look at the following code which generates a number in the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

Try writing in the following example in [omp4.c](./omp4.c)

```c
// This program computes the fibonacci sequence.
// Compile with: gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp4.c -o omp4

#include <stdio.h>

int fib_recursive(int n){
  // base case
  if(n < 2){
   return 1;
  }
  // Accumulate our result 
  return fib_recursive(n-1)+fib_recursive(n-2);
}


int main(){
  
  // Computes the 41st number(n+1) in the fibonacci sequence
  printf("%d ",fib_recursive(40));
  printf("\n");
  
  return 0;
}
```

- Compile with: `gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp omp4.c -o omp4`
**Run the program above**: With `time ./omp4`

So the question now is, with this algorithm is there any potential parallelism? Well, in our current implementation, not so much. We need to transform our algorithm slightly, so we can remove data dependency.

Take a look below and see how OpenMP can be used to separate work into different tasks. Update [omp4.c](./omp4.c) with the below snippet.

```c
// A new snippet
// Compile with: gcc -std=c11 -fopenmp omp4.c -o omp4

int fib_recursive(int n){
  // base case
  if(n < 2){
   return 1;
  }
  // Some shared variables
  int x,y;

  // Accumulate our result
  #pragma omp task shared(x) 
  x = fib_recursive(n-1);
  #pragma omp task shared(y)
  y = fib_recursive(n-2);
  #pragma omp taskwait
  return x + y;
}
```

**Run the program above**: With `time ./omp4`

Note that you may not see any performance gain--why?
*There is little performance gain because you are only using two threads and you are using a fibonacci implementation that does a lot of repeat calculations.*

**Discuss with your partner and answer:** *answer in a sentence here, why there may not be any performance gain here*

#### Example 5 - Computing PI 3.1415....

You may remember that we watched an OpenMP [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ1k_YpyG_A&list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG&index=6) on computing PI. Let's go ahead and type in this code, first in serial, and then you can parallelize it. Again, this is a nice example, because you can check that your solution does indeed add up to PI.

Try writing in the following example in [omp5.c](./omp5.c)

```c
// gcc -std=c11 -fopenmp omp5.c -o omp5
#include <stdio.h>

static long num_steps = 100000000;
double step;

int main(){
  int i;
  double x, pi, sum = 0.0;
  
  step = 1.0/(double)num_steps;
  for(i =0; i < num_steps; i++){
    x = (i+0.5)*step;
    sum = sum+ 4.0/(1.0+x*x);
  }
  pi = step * sum;
  
  printf("PI = %f\n", pi);
 
  return 0;
}

```

Now we are going to try to solve this problem in parallel.

In general, this is a type of [Reduction](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/parallel-pattern-7-reduce/222000718) algorithm, in that we are chunking our problem and solving pieces of it, and then rebuilding the result.

**Discuss with your partner and answer:** *What is a strategy for solving this problem? Try to avoid false sharing by adding the amount of padded bits needed programmatically*

Now implement in [omp5.c](./omp5.c) your strategy and time it:** Implement your strategy and fill out the table below with how much time it takes per thread.

Note: You can revisit [Tim Mattson's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuzYICZUthM&list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG&index=7) if you get stuck for one potential solution.

#### Example 6 - Quick Sort (+0.5 bonus)

Do a little bit of research with your partner to understand [quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort). Implement a parallel version of quick sort in [omp6.c](./omp6.c) sorting 10000 randomly generated numbers. A nice sample pdf of [Quick Sort](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/sc16-openmp-booth-tasking-ruud.pdf) is provided if you get stuck.
