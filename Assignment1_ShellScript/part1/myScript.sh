# I am a big fan of the Patriots and I closely follow the NFL. 
# This script will process the scores across the NFL for the current week.
# It will show the year and week, along with the Patriots game automatically.
# The script will also allow the user to request the score of any team that week.

# Additionally, I would not like you to use this for Piazza.

# First, let's make a welcome message, using echo. Echo simply prints text onto the terminal.
# I printed the 0-length strings to add spacing between lines.

echo ""
echo "Welcome to the auto NFL score script"
echo ""

# Next, we will call the curl function. Curl transfers data to and from a server.
# In this case, we are transferring webpage data.
# The -s option hides the progress meter, while the -o prints the output
# into a new file.

curl -s http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/scorestrip/ss.xml -o scores.txt

# The first thing i want to know is the current week and season.
# To do this, I make a function called getnext. When called,
# getnext will use the read command to parse the output.
# The -d option allows me to set my own delimiter (in this case, a space.
# The TAG is a variable that stores the string privided by the read command.

getnext () {
	read -d ' ' TAG
}

# I use cat to select the scores.txt file as the one to process,
# and I use grep to find the line in scores.txt that contains the week and year info.
# The output is sent to test.txt.

cat scores.txt | grep 'w=' > test.txt

# I then run getnext iteratively on my test.txt file to split the
# line of text. This will allow me to isolate the week and year
# information on separate lines.

cat test.txt | while getnext ; do
	echo "$TAG" >> test2.txt
done

# Now that I have my week and year info ready, I can print the
# information that I want. For each line of information that
# I need, I use grep to find that line, and I then use sed
# to format that line into a user-friendly format, which is then
# printed to the terminal.
# Example output:
# Week 2
# Year 2019

grep 'w' test2.txt | sed 's/w=/Week /;s/"//g'

grep 'y' test2.txt | sed 's/y=/Year /;s/"//g'

echo ""

# Next, I will use the same method to find data for the Patriots game.
# I once again use commands to split up the information and format the
# lines to be printed to the terminal.
#
# Example output:
# This week's Patriots game:
#
# Game ID Number: 2019090505
# Day in the week: Sun
# Game time: 8:20
# Home team abbreviation: NE
# Home team name: patriots
# Home team score: 33
# Visiting team abbreviation: PIT
# Visiting team name: steelers
# Visiting team score: 3
