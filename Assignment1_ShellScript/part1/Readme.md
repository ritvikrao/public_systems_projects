# Automate (some of) your life

Getting familiar with the terminal is a fundamental skill to have, as you may not always have a neat graphical user interface ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) environment available to you. Many of you have various levels of experience using the terminal, so you will have some flexibility to be creative and push your skills.

For this assignment, you will be warming up by writing a 1-2 page tutorial on bash scripting. Your tutorial will be embededded in a shell script, explaining how to do something on the terminal that is non-trivial and automates some task that can be useful to you. You will run your script by typing `sh myScript.sh` on the command line as an executable shell script(sh is the GNU Bourne-Again SHell (type [man sh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sh) on the terminal for more information).  You can look at example 'sh' scripts for inspiration on what you can achieve on the web, but you must cite them appropriately in your [README.md](./../README.md). 

### How to write your tutorial

The tutorial will be done purely in text and and within a file called 'myscript.sh'. You are required to type your tutorial using a terminal based text editor like 'vim', 'emacs', or 'nano' to write your tutorial (I personally use the vim text editor in my class).

Examples of a non-trivial scripts

* Sort a particular column of data from a .csv file (e.g. stock prices). Then print out the top ten values, and the average of that column of data.
* Write a shell script that downloads a webpage, and then parses it to determine what the weather is today.
* Write a shell script that allows you to query information about your computer system from a menu of options. Users might like to know information like hard drive space, if a graphics card is available, how fast the cpu is, etc.
* Write a shell script that downloads a webpage (using wget, perhaps to grab some json data), then parses some of the data, and prints it to the terminal. 
* You can use your imagination to create other examples.

# Part 1 - myScript.sh

## Very Brief Example Tutorial (Template)
(Note this example is fairly trivial, probably worth a C-. You can use it as a template)

```
# Problem Statement: "Often I have to search for different files and directories within my computer system. 
#                     In order to do this I use the 'ls' command to help orient myself.
# Name of command: ls
# 
# Example of its usage: 
# -bash-4.2$ ls
# Lab1  README.md

# Here is the myScript.sh script that can list the directories and how many total directories are in the current folder.
# usage: sh myScript.sh

ls
ls | wc -l
```

Some ideas for improving the script above script to earn closer to an A are the following:

- Print out a 'tree' visualization of the directory you are searching.
- Output the amount of file space each directory is taking up
- Output some graphical patterns after running the command.
- List the history of the last 100 commands that have been run.
  - Then sort how frequently they are used.

# Part 2 - VIM and TMUX

<img align="right" width="300px" src="https://joshldavis.com/img/vim/tabs.gif">

(Note this part is ungraded--but you are required to do it!)

Figuring out a good workflow on Unix, Mac, or windows is an important part of becoming a good software engineer. My work environment (and the suggested one so I can help you during class), is to use the combination of the VIM text editor and tmux window manager to program your assignments in.

### Student and Teacher Dialouge

*"But I love visual studio, sublime, XCode, Atom, etc."*

*That's great, but you cannot always use those in a remote environment easily--so I suggest learning another skill. By all means, use both or multiple tools to write the highest quality code--but do not limit yourself to one tool*

*"Hehe, the professor will never know if I just use notepad. I'll just take a shortcut on this assignment"*

*While that's true you can take a shortcut now, it will eventually catch up to you. I promise this is a good skill to learn! This first assignment is much more lightweight, take the time now to do things properly.*

Here are some suggested resources to get started.

* [VIM+TMUX Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD9aFIvlQYs)  (16:31)
* Type [man tmux](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tmux) in a terminal.
* [Tmux tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHhA_ZKjyxo) -  (11:23)
* [Vim Cheatsheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/) - A handy cheat sheet for navigting Vim. Practice mastering one thing at a time (Make this your desktop background to help learn quickly :) ).

# Part 3 - The Network is down! How to work locally.

Sometimes ssh is not available if the internet is not. Hmm, how will we then work on our Khoury machines which are in a linux environment? The solution is to install locally (i.e. your desktop machine) a virtual machine. A virtual machine emulates an entire operating system!

Here appear to be two useful videos on getting setup:

1. [Installing Ubuntu in Virtual Box on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbmRXJJKsvs)
2. [Install Ubuntu in Virtual Box on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SbTXqPk_1Y)

The instructions to get setup are here:

**Note** If you are on windows and have the Windows Linux Subsystem, you can submit a screenshot of that running. That *should be* sufficient for most things in this course. And if you are using linux...just submit a screenshot of your desktop (You may still find the exercise useful however--especially if you want to test software on multiple OS's).

* First start downloading a linux-based operating system. I am strongly encouraging [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) 
  * While our Khoury machines are actually CentOS for the operating system, Ubuntu will work just fine (The core kernel is the same).
  * The download is rather large, so start with this step! :)
* Visit [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Download the binary for Virtual box 5.2 or later.
  1. This will show up as "Windows hosts" for window users, OSX hosts for mac users, etc.
* Install the program using the default installation settings (i.e. you will click 'next' a bunch of times).
* When installation has completed, launch Virtaul Box.
* Next click 'new' in the top right, and select *Linux* from the 'Type' dropbown box.
  1. You can name it something like 'myUbuntuMachine'
  2. Click 'next'
  3. You can then configure the memory size. I recommend at least 4096 MB (Unless that is not more than half of what you have available).
  4. Click 'next' and then create a Virtual Hard disk(default option). This essentially creates a giant file that acts like a hard drive.
  5. You can create a VDI (Virtual Disk Image). Click next.
  6. For the storage, you can select 'Dynamically allocated'
* Okay, now you are configured, and ready to boot your OS!
  1. Go ahead and right-click on your machine name, and select 'start'. 
  2. This will begin launching your virtual machine (It may take a few minutes to create some files)
  3. The first dialog will ask where your media is, and you will select wherever you downloaded the Ubuntu 18 .iso file (in step 1).
  4. Then run through the 'normal install'
  5. Follow the dialogs to install Ubuntu.
  6. Remember, you are working within a virtual environment, so this installation is only taking place within virtual box.
  7. From within Ubuntu, try opening a terminal. Run `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to make sure you get some tools(like our compiler gcc) setup.

Again, if you have a linux machine you may not need a virtual machine. What is nice about a virtual machine however, is if you mess something up, you can always reboot it and start from scratch very easily.

### Wait, can I clone my github repository to multiple places?

Yes, the idea here is you can ``git clone`` your repository in multiple locations(e.g. once on the khoury servers, and again locally on your Virtual Machine). You can work in each repository, and then push your changes online in whatever environment you are in. Then if the khoury servers which you are ssh'ing into are down for any reason, you can do a ``git pull`` in a local linux environment, still make forward progress, then push your changes (Then next time you ssh to the khoury servers, you would do a git pull, and then make updates).

* Note: Your code **must** run on the Khoury machines. That is where you should test it, and this is where we grade it!
* Note: You must also commit any additional files into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!

# Feedback Loop

(An optional task that will reinforce your learning throughout the semester)

Read this [lifehacker article](https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-quickly-learn-terminal-commands-1494082178) and implement the 'whatis' command in your .bashrc. 

```
echo "Did you know that:"; whatis $(ls /bin | shuf -n 1)
```

This is a nice way to learn a new command everytime you log on!
