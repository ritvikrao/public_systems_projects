*The main function is referred to as just main, while foo is called _Z3fooii.*

2. Do we have some information that could be useful for LD_PRELOAD if we were writing a function to override that function? That is, what information do we need to use to name a function?

*We are given that foo is a global symbol and a function, and  we are also given foo's size.*

3. How many add_generic functions are there? What is your best guess for what the compiler is doing behind the scenes to implement the 'templating' feature?
