# Logistics

**---------------> Read the warning about fork bombs in the readme <-------------**

**i.e. do 99.9% of your testing on your local virtual machine**

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work.
