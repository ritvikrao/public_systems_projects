## Static Analysis 
 
Our Cycle Count Tool is what we call a 'static analysis'. That is, it uncovers information about our programs before it is running (during compile-time). Given that our tool uncovers information before the program, what is (at least) one pro of this, and one con you can think of?

## Dyanmic Analysis

The opposite of a static analysis is a dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis tools record and return information about programs that are in the process or have finished executing. An example of a dynamic analysis tool is [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/). What do you think a pro and con of dynamic analysis would be?
